/**
 * The Subsets pattern is a common approach used in problems where you need to explore all possible subsets of a set. This pattern is particularly useful in combinatorial problems, such as those that require generating all possible configurations of a set, exploring all subsets of a set, or finding all combinations that satisfy certain criteria.
 * 
 * Key characteristics and operations of the Subsets pattern include:
 * 
 * 1. Generating all subsets:
 *    - This involves generating every possible combination of elements from the original set. The number of subsets of a set with 'n' elements is 2^n.
 *    - Example: For a set {1, 2, 3}, the subsets are {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, and {1, 2, 3}.
 *    - Task: Implement a function that generates all subsets of a given set of integers.
 * 
 * 2. Backtracking to generate subsets:
 *    - Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
 *    - Example: Generating all subsets of a set can be done using backtracking by considering each element in the set, deciding to include or not include the element in the current subset, and recursively solving for the rest of the elements.
 *    - Task: Write a recursive function to generate all subsets using backtracking.
 * 
 * 3. Bit Manipulation to generate subsets:
 *    - Each subset of a set can be represented by a binary number, where the bit at position 'i' is 1 if the ith element of the set is included in the subset, otherwise 0.
 *    - Example: For the set {1, 2, 3}, the subset {1, 3} can be represented by the binary number 101 (which is 5 in decimal).
 *    - Task: Develop a function that uses bit manipulation to generate all subsets of a set.
 * 
 * These techniques are not only fundamental in understanding how combinations and permutations are generated but are also applicable in various fields such as statistics, computer security (for generating combinations of passwords), and in generating test cases in software testing.
