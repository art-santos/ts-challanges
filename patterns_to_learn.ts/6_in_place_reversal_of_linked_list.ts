/**
 * In-Place Reversal of Linked Lists Pattern
 *
 * The In-Place Reversal of Linked Lists pattern is a crucial technique in algorithm design, particularly useful for reversing linked lists without using extra space for another list. This pattern is essential for optimizing memory usage and improving performance in scenarios where space complexity is a concern. Below are key points and examples where the In-Place Reversal pattern can be applied:
 *
 * 1. **Reversing a Single Linked List**:
 *    - Problem: Given a singly linked list, reverse the list in place.
 *    - Example: Implement a function that takes the head of a singly linked list and reverses the links between the nodes to produce a reversed linked list.
 *
 * 2. **Reversing Sub-lists**:
 *    - Problem: Given a linked list and positions `m` and `n`, reverse the sublist that starts at position `m` and ends at position `n`.
 *    - Example: Write a function that modifies the linked list in place to reverse the portion of the list between the given positions without altering the rest of the list.
 *
 * 3. **Reversing Every K-Elements Sub-list**:
 *    - Problem: Given a linked list and a number `k`, reverse every `k` consecutive elements of the list.
 *    - Example: Develop a function that processes the linked list in chunks of `k` elements, reversing each chunk in place while maintaining the overall order of these reversed chunks.
 *
 * 4. **Palindrome Linked List Check**:
 *    - Problem: Determine if a linked list is a palindrome.
 *    - Example: Create a function that uses the in-place reversal to reverse the second half of the list, then compares it with the first half to check if the list represents a palindrome.
 *
 * Each of these problems can be efficiently solved using the In-Place Reversal of Linked Lists pattern, which leverages the properties of linked list nodes and their connections to manipulate the list structure directly.
 *
 * The following examples will be implemented to demonstrate the practical application of the In-Place Reversal pattern in solving complex problems involving linked lists.
