 * Modified Binary Search Patterns
 *
 * Binary search is a classic algorithm in computer science to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. The algorithm compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare with the target, until the target is found. This process cuts the search space in half each time, making the search operation very efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n).
 *
 * However, there are many scenarios where the basic binary search algorithm is modified to fit specific needs. Here are some common patterns of modified binary search:
 *
 * 1. **Finding the First or Last Position of an Element**:
 *    - Sometimes, instead of finding any position of the element, one might need to find the first or last occurrence of it in a sorted array. This is particularly useful in scenarios involving ranges or intervals.
 *    - Example: Implement a function to find the first position of a given target in a sorted array. This will involve modifying the binary search to continue searching upon finding the target, to check if there is another equal element to the left.
 *
 * 2. **Searching in a Rotated Sorted Array**:
 *    - In some cases, the sorted array might be rotated (the beginning of the array comes after the end). A modified binary search can be used to find elements in such an array.
 *    - Example: Write a function to determine if a given number is in a rotated sorted array. The function should use binary search to find the pivot point (where the order breaks) and then perform binary search on the appropriate segment.
 *
 * 3. **Finding the Closest Element**:
 *    - Finding the closest element to a target value in a sorted array is another variation. This involves not only finding the target but also deciding which of the closest elements is the nearest.
 *    - Example: Develop a function that returns the closest element to a given target number in a sorted array. This will involve modifying the binary search to keep track of the closest number encountered so far.
 *
 * 4. **Finding the Peak Element in an Array**:
 *    - A peak element in an array is an element that is greater than its neighbors. In a modified binary search, one can find a peak element in a logarithmic time.
 *    - Example: Implement a function to find a peak element in an array, assuming that the array has at least one peak.
 *
 * Each of these examples requires a nuanced understanding of binary search and its adaptations to meet specific criteria. These modifications often involve adding conditions to the standard binary search process, handling edge cases, and deciding when to terminate the search.
