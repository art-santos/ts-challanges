/**
 * Sliding Window Pattern
 *
 * The Sliding Window pattern is a methodical approach used to create a moving subset out of a larger set (typically an array or list) to solve problems that require examining a contiguous block of elements. This pattern is particularly useful for problems that involve arrays or strings where you need to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays or substrings of a given size or condition. Here are some key points and examples where the Sliding Window pattern can be applied:
 *
 * 1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**:
 *    - Problem: Given an array of integers and a number k, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k.
 *    - Example: Implement a function that uses a sliding window to traverse the array, calculating the sum of each window and updating the maximum sum found.
 *
 * 2. **Smallest Subarray with a given sum**:
 *    - Problem: Given an array of positive integers and a number s, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to s.
 *    - Example: Use a sliding window to expand and contract dynamically while keeping track of the sum of the elements within the window.
 *
 * 3. **Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters**:
 *    - Problem: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains no more than k distinct characters.
 *    - Example: Implement a function that uses a sliding window approach with a hashmap to count the frequency of characters within the window.
 *
 * 4. **String Permutations**:
 *    - Problem: Given a string and a pattern, find all starting indices of the pattern's permutations in the string.
 *    - Example: Use a sliding window to match all characters of the pattern with the current window in the string, adjusting the window size and position as needed.
 *
 * Each of these problems can be efficiently solved using the Sliding Window pattern, which leverages the properties of contiguous data and the ability to adjust the size and position of the window dynamically.
 *
 * The following examples will be implemented to demonstrate the practical application of the Sliding Window pattern in solving complex problems involving arrays and strings.
